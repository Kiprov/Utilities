# Important.
This is an entity spawner made specifically for a roblox game called "ENDLESS DOORS".
I have to thank @RegularVynixu for providing me with his old entity spawner that i remade into his entity spawner v2 and improved it.
Remember to use this README file to understand how to use the entity spawner.
# Setup of the Entity Spawner.
Firstly you want to copy the raw link of the "Source.lua" file.
Then you want to make a new blank txt or lua file.
Now paste this code into your file.
```lua
```
